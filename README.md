# Stor Scheduler
This is a project I am doing for [Michael O'Neill](https://stor.unc.edu/faculty-member/oneill-michael/) and the [UNC STOR Department](https://stor.unc.edu/).

I am designing a tool that takes in professor references, available courses, and department practices and returns a functional semester course schedule for the whole department. The project is in Java and uses [Gurobi](https://www.gurobi.com/) as the solver.

This project is currently designed with the STOR department's specific requirments and data in mind. The goal is to eventually generalize for other deparments.
