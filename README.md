# Stor Scheduler (CLASSic SCHEDULING)
This is a project I am doing for [Michael O'Neill](https://stor.unc.edu/faculty-member/oneill-michael/) and the [UNC STOR Department](https://stor.unc.edu/).

I am designing a tool that takes in user input and returns a functional department course schedule for the semester. The project is in Java and uses [Gurobi](https://www.gurobi.com/) as the solver.

This project is currently in the early phases where I am just trying to have it return a working schedule with the STOR department's specific requirments and data. The goal is to eventually generalize this for other deparments.
